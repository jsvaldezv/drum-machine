This is a real-time, browser-based drum machine built entirely with vanilla JavaScriptâ€”no frameworks, no libraries. It features a responsive interface where you can trigger and customize rhythmic patterns directly from your browser.

The drum machine includes several preloaded presets to get you started, and also supports custom patterns by loading your own .json files. Each instrument (kick, snare, hi-hat, etc.) can be programmed with its own sequence of steps.

Key features:

- Real-time playback and interaction
- Adjustable BPM (beats per minute)
- Per-instrument step sequencing
- JSON support for loading and saving custom patterns

Whether you're prototyping beats or just having fun, this tool offers an intuitive and dynamic rhythm-making experience directly in the browser.
